      <h2>Percentage of Renewable Energy Consumption</h2>
      <p>This map shows the percentage of renewable energy consumption by country. It provides insights into the geographical distribution of countries leading in the adoption of clean energy.
        As         fossil fuels(natural gas, oil, and coal)accounting for approximately 80% of its energMalaysia navigates the complexities of energy consumption, the nation stands at a crossroads. With a rich tapestry of energy resources, the country has historically relied on 
y supply in 2020. However, the winds of change are blowing, with increasing pressure to transition to renewable energy sources to combat climate change and promote sustainability.

      <h2>Amount Invested in Different Types of Energy</h2>
      <p>This chart presents the amount invested in various types of energy (renewable and non-renewable) over recent years. It emphasizes the growing financial commitment to clean energy infrastructure.
        Malaysia's investments tell a compelling story. In 2021, approximately $5 billion was allocated to renewable energy projects,
         a notable increase from just $2 billion in 2015. In contrast, investments in non-renewable energy sources have remained stagnant at around $8 billion. This shift indicates a growing recognition of the importance of renewables; however, to achieve its goal of 20% renewable energy generation by 2025, Malaysia must significantly ramp up investment.

      <h2>Annual CO2 emissions (per capita)</h2>
      <p>The line chart showcasing CO2 Emissions Per Capita for Malaysia and four other major countries provides a perspective on the environmental impact of energy consumption. While Malaysia's CO2 emissions per capita stand at approximately 8 metric tons, it remains lower than countries like Australia (15 metric tons) and United States (14 metric tons).
        This data illustrates that, although Malaysia is making strides towards sustainability, it still has a significant carbon footprint that needs to be addressed through cleaner energy solutions.
